      <description>This interactive database viewer was built as part of a year long project of restarting the Clarence Stein Institute of Urban and Landscape Studies at the Department of City and Regional Planning, Cornell University. The work was part of my year long appointment at the Institute from August 2017 to August 2018.
The interactive database documents the projects funded by the Institute from its establishment in 1992 to 2015. The institute has funded projects across the entire world!</description>

      <description>Hi! I am a researcher interested in developing data driven insights to inform public policy. I currently work as a Research Associate at the Department of Economics and Public Policy, Indian School of Business Hyderabad with Ashwini Chhatre and Avik Sarkar.
My interdisciplinary pursuits span across fields Urban and Regional Planning, Real Estate, Economics and Public Policy. I am currently working on;
Infrastructure Policy: Studying the equity implications of capital investments in large-scale infrastructure on demography, land acquisition and the environment; Food Systems: Designing experiments and policies for promoting cultivation, public distribution and consumption of sustainable millets in regions vulnerable to climate change, and lastly, Digital Identity: understanding the potential of unique digital identity in India to inform bureaucratic decision making for food, employment and scholarship welfare schemes.</description>
