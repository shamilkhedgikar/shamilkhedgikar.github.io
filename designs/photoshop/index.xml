      <title>Urban Governance in India; Policies, Provisions and Reforms</title>
      <link>https://shamilkhedgikar.github.io/portfolio/wharton_report/</link>

It is relevant due to the fact that many of the laws established during the colonial rule in India, especially those pertaining to cantonments and towns considered significant by the British have shaped the modern governance policies in India.</description>
