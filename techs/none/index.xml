      <description>The research will primarily focus on urban areas in India, as defined through the Census of India definitions. The first section will provide a brief overview of the history of governance in India. It is relevant due to the fact that many of the laws established during the colonial rule in India, especially those pertaining to cantonments and towns considered significant by the British have shaped the modern governance policies in India.</description>
